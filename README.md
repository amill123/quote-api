# quote-api
This project was to create API for accessing quotes

Some of the code was provided, through Codecademy.
I have created the api.js and quotes.js files and all content within (for now). 

Additional changes:
    - added id's to the quotes in data.js
    - modified the server.js file to include:
        - listen for the PORT
        - require the api.js file

Future things to change:
    - Have added get /:id, put /:id, delete /:id as API endpoints therefore need to add the ability to access them from the front-end
